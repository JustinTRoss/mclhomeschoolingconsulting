  title: Who is MCL Consulting?
  description: >-
    Greetings! My name is Megan Lopez and I am a lifetime homeschooler and
    licensed K-8 educator in the state of Nevada. I graduated from the
    University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a bachelor's in elementary education
    and I am currently teaching 3rd grade at a state operated charter-- which I
    love! I was homeschooled all my life from 1st-12th grade. I often find it
    ironic that I became a public school educator, but education is where my
    heart lays. 


    Growing up I didn’t always love being homeschooled (shocking, I know). But looking back now I realized what a quality and individualized education I received and I wanted to be able to give that type of education to a whole class of students! Flash forward to spending nearly 8 years in the educational field and I have realized that many families still desire a more personal experience for their child’s educational needs. 


    That’s where I come in! With my experience as a homeschooler, and as a practicing and licensed educator, my heart is to help you. I want families to know that making the decision to homeschool is a personal decision, but you do not have to feel alone. My goal and passion is to help families navigate the often unfamiliar waters of homeschooling. Let me help inform you on the basics, create an educational plan for your kids, and meet your families individual needs through my consulting services.
